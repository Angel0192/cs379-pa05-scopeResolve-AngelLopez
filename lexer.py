"""
PA 4 dependency: paste in YOUR OWN completed PA 2 lexer.py here.

This is the same file from PA 2's repo -- copy your own working
tokenize() implementation over this stub before starting parser.py.
Every PA repo is independent (no shared filesystem across repos), so
each pipeline stage bundles its own copy of the prior stages.

Complete tokenize() below. See the assignment, Part B,
for the full requirements. Must use a single compiled master regex
with named groups -- not a hand-rolled character-by-character loop.
